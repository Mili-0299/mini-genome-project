# 🧬 Mini Genome Analysis Project

This is a **bioinformatics demonstration project** showcasing core skills in genome data processing, analysis, and visualization — all implemented in **Python**.

---

## 💼 Why I’m a Strong Fit
As an aspiring bioinformatics professional, I combine:
- **Solid coding skills** in Python for biological data analysis
- **Attention to reproducible workflows** with organized project structures
- **Data visualization abilities** to turn numbers into insights
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaborative work

This project is an example of how I can take raw biological data and turn it into clean, actionable results — a workflow I can quickly adapt to real-world datasets and pipelines.
